# Instructions
## Shiny

`app.Rmd` and its associated files create an R Shiny application. 

## Included documents and files:

* app.R
* .gitignore
* www/shiny.css

## Hosting

Do not change the name of app.R. It is important for hosting R Shiny applications locally and on servers. 

Shiny applications can run on any computer with R and RStudio. Just click "Run App" near the top of the R Studio window. 

The Urban Institute has a Shiny Server for hosting applications for use inside and outside of the Urban Institute. Contact Aaron Williams (awilliams@urban.org) to learn more about hosting and publishing R Shiny applications.
